# From Nand to Tetris Pt. 1, ch6.
# Create program to convert symbolic assembly code into binary code.

# Step 1: First Pass
# Go through & identify symbol positions (i.e. (LOOP), (END), etc.)
# Create a symbol table to keep track of built-in symbols as well as
# symbols declared by the code.


# Step 2: Second Pass
# Convert all symbolic code into binary assembly code.
# Catch all variables and record them to the symbol table,
# staring memory at n = 16 and counting up from there.


# Step 3: Write to File
# Should use the same file name with .hack as the ending.
# Assembly code only, no comments or whitespace.
